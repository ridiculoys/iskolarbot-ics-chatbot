What are the advantages of using psychophysiological measures in assessing user state?,"['(ANS) is responsible for controlling the involuntary muscles and internal organs. The leading measures of the ANS are Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Pupil Dilation, Eye Movements, Galvanic Skin Response (Skin Conductance) and Electromyogram (EMG). Autonomic nervous system also has two components, Sympathetic (SNS) and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems (PNS). SNS is responsible about the mobilization of body for emergencies and PNS maintain bodily resources. \n3.3.1. Advantages  \nPsychophysiological measures have 6 important advantages. These are objectivity, multidimensionality, \nunobtrusiveness, implicitness, continuity and responsiveness. \nxObjectivity:  By means of objectivity it’s possible to make assessments that do not depend on the user’s \nperception [3].

"How can psychophysiological measures show potential in assessing user affective or cognitive state, despite challenges?","['user affective or cognitive state. A great deal of studies shows that psychophysiological measures have the potential to meet these requirements.
