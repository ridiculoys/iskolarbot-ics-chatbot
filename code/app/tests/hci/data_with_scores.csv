How does the use of a defining metaphor contribute to the interface design process in relation to human factors or user needs?,"The use of a defining metaphor in the interface design process plays a crucial role in addressing human factors and user needs. By developing a defining metaphor that resonates with the user's personal experience, the interface becomes more intuitive and user-friendly. This metaphor serves as a conceptual model for the interface, enabling users to understand and interact with the system more effectively [1].

Göktürk, ""Psychophysiological Measures of Human Cognitive States Applied in Human Computer Interaction,"" *Procedia Computer Science*, vol. 3, pp. 1361-1367, 2011.

Data quality in psychophysiological applications, especially in real environments, poses several challenges. In real environments, issues become more complex due to the drawbacks related to data quality. The artificial nature of controlled environments can also impact the interaction, leading to unnaturalness. Researchers face challenges in selecting appropriate psychophysiological measures that are susceptible to noise and require suitable filtering techniques to address confounding factors like ambient lighting, power grid interference, and body movements. The interpretation of the large amount of data produced by psychophysiological measures is another significant challenge for researchers and engineers [2].

Application Guidelines \nWhen psychophysiological measures are applied either in controlled laboratory or in real environments, there are \nmany issues that must be considered. Especially in real environments, problems are much more complicated because of the disadvantages given in the previous section, particularly the ones regarding the data quality. Controlled environments, on the other hand, cause the interaction to be artificial (unnaturalness). While the users are asked to behave naturally when they are connected to electrodes, experimenters hope to obtain results that show their natural/real behavior [2]. \nGenerally, the first problem of a psychophysiological application is selecting one or possibly more'
 'signals and may be highly susceptible to noise [13]. Therefore suitable filtering techniques should be selected and applied to data. Besides a number of them are very vulnerable to confounding factors like ambient lightning (pupil dilation), power grid (ERP), and body movement (ECG). These factors should not be omitted; otherwise misleading results will be inevitable. Data interpretation is another problem for researcher and engineers. It’s because of that psychophysiological measures produce large amount of hard-to-analyze data.  \nxUnnaturalness Disadvantages:  Especially in laboratories, the environment is sufficiently artificial and unnatural. \nWith advances of recent technologies portable and wireless solutions are possible for some measures like EEG, GRS and HR. if not; electrodes are attached to user by cables and this causes the user movements to be constrained and break the naturalness of the interaction  \n3.4.

Each measure has its own ability to represent different psychological processes, advantages and disadvantages. For accurate measurements and successful applications, psychophysiological measures are needed to be combined most of the time. This is particularly important for real life applications. Consequently, seeking appropriate measure combinations, overcoming implementation shortcomings and developing new interaction methods based on these combinations may be given as important future studies. \nThe number of applications that exploits psychophysiological measures in HCI is in a constant flux.

They are able to present different dimensions of human psychological processes with changing levels. However, psychophysiological measures are needed to be carefully implemented. Especially, data acquisition and interpretation disadvantages prevent them to be implemented in real environments. We think that, although they do not completely disappear, these problems will be alleviated in time and psychophysiological measures will be easier to research and more applicable. \nReferences \n1.

"How did early computer specialists communicate with computers in a way similar to brain waves, involving learning binary language for programming?","During the early years of computing, computer specialists communicated with computers by learning the binary language, similar to brain waves. This involved directly programming in binary, where each instruction corresponded to a binary code. Assembler languages then provided mnemonics for easier coding, reducing errors and increasing productivity. Subsequently, high-level languages like APL, Lisp, and Forth offered problem-solving tools with English-like commands, enhancing user leverage over computer resources [1][2].

 'Conclusions \n • Was there an identifiable set of relationships \n between humans and computers?

In the Computer Liter- \n acy classes, students were much more orient- \n ed to working with the hardware. Although \n they did not refer to the computer as a per- \n son, they did admit to thinking of it in a \n human role, often as an assistant. Most of the \n computer literacy students also acknowledged \n that they thought of the machine having an \n existence of its own. None of the groups \n acknowledged any recognition of values or \n biases embedded in the computer interface, \n but all felt that the designers and program- \n mers were probably white, middle-class, and \n in their thirties.

Students in the BASIC class \n were not good typists, which slowed their data en- \n try considerably, and a fair amount of interaction \n attention was therefore focused on the keyboard. \n The teacher of the class distributed model pro- \n grams and exercises, which the students attempted \n to enter correctly; original programming was writ- \n ten out as part of the seatwork assignment and was \n entered on-line.
