How does Lehman classify software systems in relation to embedded systems and software evolution/maintenance by Swanson and Chapin?,"['Meir Lehman in 1980[4]. The basic purpose of software is to provide an automation solution to user problems and reduce the human effects in order to maximize output.

Lehman’s laws describe “the software evolution as a force responsible for driving new and revising developments in a system” [4].
