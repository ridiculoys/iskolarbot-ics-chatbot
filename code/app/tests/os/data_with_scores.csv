How are harmful applications typically installed on devices that are not available in the Apple store?,"Harmful applications, such as potential hack tools, are typically not available in the Apple store. To install these applications on devices that are not in the Apple store, suspects often resort to side loading via the terminal [1]. This method allows them to bypass the restrictions of the Apple store and install unauthorized applications for their use.

How has Microsoft's introduction of Surface tablets impacted the technology industry and their position in the market?,"Microsoft's introduction of Surface tablets has had a significant impact on the technology industry and their position in the market. With the introduction of Windows 8 and Surface tablets, Microsoft aimed to transition from being the top desktop OS to the top device OS.

How does the scarcity of macOS forensic tools and increased Mac OS security affect the need for live forensic acquisition in analyzing Mac OS systems?,"[1] E. Prasad, D. S, and D. Lakshmi, ""Towards Live Forensic Acquisition & Analysis Of Mac OS Systems,"" *IEEE Transactions on Cyber Forensics*, Mar. 2018.

Live forensic acquisition is crucial in analyzing Mac OS systems due to the scarcity of macOS forensic tools and the increased security measures implemented by Mac OS. The macOS systems are commonly used in criminal activities, necessitating a thorough analysis of the machine. However, the availability of tools for macOS forensics is limited, making live forensics more valuable for correlating evidence compared to offline methods. The enhanced security features of macOS pose challenges for forensic analysis, but the artifacts left by suspects can still be retrieved and analyzed using sophisticated tools for live forensics on macOS machines [1].

What role does the host name play in live forensics analysis for revealing suspect activities and potential evidence on a seized system?,"The host name in live forensics analysis plays a crucial role in revealing suspect activities and potential evidence on a seized system.
