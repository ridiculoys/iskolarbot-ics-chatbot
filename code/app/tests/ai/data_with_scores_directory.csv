How does the spiking encoder model transfer information between neurons in the context of computational tractability?,"The spiking encoder model transfers information between neurons by firing a spike to the next neuron. Specifically, the model transforms the input representation into spikes using a spiking-convert function, where the activation threshold plays a crucial role. Contextual information is captured by considering the features of the last time step. To ensure computational tractability, the model integrates firing-and-resetting mechanisms to balance signals from input and previous hidden states, resulting in an accumulated voltage that drives the model's behavior [1].

How is energy consumption of each model setting measured in the study on machine translation tasks?,"In the study on machine translation tasks, the energy consumption of each model setting is measured by considering various factors such as the sizes of hidden state and word embedding, the number of heads in the MHSAN layer, the dimensionality of the inner connection in the FFN layers, the learning rate, the dropout ratio, the decay factor, and the threshold for firing. Specifically, for the T RANSFORMER baseline model, the number of heads in the MHSAN layer is 4, and the dimensionality of the inner connection in the FFN layers is 4 times the embedding size. On the other hand, for the bi-SNN model, the sizes of hidden state and word embedding are both 100, and max pooling is utilized to derive representations along with the dimension of sequence length, resulting in a d-dimensional contextual semantics for prediction. The learning rate is set at 0.001, the dropout ratio at 0.5, the decay factor at 0.2, and the threshold for firing at 0.5. Word embeddings are initialized with pre-trained GloVe word vectors across all models, and each experimental result represents the averaged value and variance of prediction accuracy over 5 independent experimental runs [1].

 'neural-based NLU systems.\nThe main reason for high energy consumption in vanilla neu-\nral models lies in a large amount of multiplication operations [7].\nWith the increase of dimensionality, multiplications in transfor-\nmation functions exponentially enlarge the computational costs.\nTo tackle this problem, existing studies mainly focus on com-\npressing the hidden size via removing redundant dimensions,\nsuch as knowledge distillation [8] and channel pruning [9].

How is sentiment embedding used in sentiment classification for aspect-based analysis with Bi-GRU and aspect matrix?,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis involves using deep neural networks to detect aspects and classify sentiments in text. In the context of sentiment classification for aspect-based analysis with Bi-GRU and aspect matrix, the study found that aspect detection with GRU layers outperformed fully-connected layers. Additionally, using an aspect model to generate an aspect matrix resulted in better performance compared to a general word embedding approach. The aspect matrix helped distinguish between sentences with similar wording but different sentiments [1].
