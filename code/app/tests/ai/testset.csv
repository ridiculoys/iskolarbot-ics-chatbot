How does the CNN-based model struggle to classify sentiment accurately in certain cases?,"['product is okay, delivery time and process of confirming the purchase should be improved next time”) the CNN-based model fails to classify the right sentiment by predicting positive for all sentiment aspects. The ‘service’ \nand ‘delivery time’ aspects should be negative in this \ncase. This case is caused by the word ‘okay’ which has moderately high probability in all aspects. The phrase, which signal the sentiment is negative, is also quite long (having more than 5 words) so CNN-based has difficulty on processing it. \nThere are some sentences which none of our models \nget these sentences right. For instance, “Pelayanan ya \nsangat buruk ga ada respon sama sekali baik pertanyaan ataupun keluhan” (“Bad service, no response for both \nquestions or complaints”), “sip dipertahankan yang akan \ndatang kecepatan pengirimannya ya jangan sampai ada \nyang ketinggalan ketinggalan lagi paketnya ...”  (“Yep,']","The CNN-based model struggles to classify sentiment accurately in certain cases because it predicts positive for all sentiment aspects, even when the sentiment is negative.

How does aspect-based sentiment analysis in the Indonesian study improve sentiment polarity determination over traditional methods?,"['detection; sentiment classification; Indonesian; deep neural \nnetwork \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \nSentiment analysis is becoming one of the important \ntopics in natural language processing (NLP).
