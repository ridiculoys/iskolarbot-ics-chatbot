# Welcome to your personal Research Assistant Chatbot! 🤖

Hey there, researcher! 👋 I'm **IskolarBot** and I'm excited to have you on board. I am a Research Assistant Chatbot - a powerful tool designed to help you query research papers from my knowledgebase. 

This application is built using Chainlit, Langchain, and OpenAI to showcase the powers of LLMs and Generative AI in education.

## Get Started 📃

Ask anything about research papers!

To start off, go to the chat tab and choose a topic. Then, ask away! Here are some examples of what you can ask:

### 1. Summaries of Papers in the Dataset
- Can you give me the summary of `<paper_title>`?
- Summarize the results and conclusion of `<paper_title>`.

### 2. Related Literature in the Dataset
- Can you give me papers about `<topic>`.
- Give me related literature by `<author name>`.

### 3. Contents of a Paper in the Dataset
- What is `<topic>`?
- Explain and give examples on `<topic>`.
- Who are the authors of `<paper_title>`?

## Additional Features

### 1. Easy-Access History
Quickly access your past queries by clicking on the arrow icon in the chatbox's left-hand side, saving time and effort by eliminating the need to retype previous inputs.

### 2. Conversation Context-Handling
Seamlessly engage in follow-up questions as the chatbot retains the context of previous conversations, enhancing continuity and understanding. To start a new conversation without the previous context, simply click the "New Chat" button.

### 3. Dark Mode 
Given user demand, the chatbot has a dark mode option, enhancing user experience by providing a visually appealing alternative to the traditional light interface.
